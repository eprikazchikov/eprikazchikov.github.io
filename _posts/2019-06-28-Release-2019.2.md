Android is a new supported platform, embedded code editor, new text render features and other cool features are waiting for you!

This release has significant changes in the Mesh related API.
First of all now mesh can contain only one logical surface. This was done to simplify the Thunder Engine API.
In the case of developer importing structure which contains more than one mesh surfaces, the importer will provide this structure as a prefab.
Unfortunately, there is no backward compatibility with the previous version of Thunder Engine. I hope you will forgive me someday.

Thunder Engine 2019.2 is now available for downloading.
